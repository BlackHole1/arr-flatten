# arr-flatten [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/arr-flatten.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/arr-flatten)


> Recursively flatten an array or arrays.

Why another flatten utility? All the other libs I found had too much junk in them, too many options, or were not fast enough in benchmarks.

## Install
#### Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i arr-flatten --save
```
#### Install with [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower)

```bash
bower install arr-flatten --save
```

## Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Usage

```js
var flatten = require('arr-flatten');

flatten(['a', ['b', ['c']]], ['d', ['e']]);
//=> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```
