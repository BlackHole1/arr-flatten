Why another flatten utility? I wanted the fastest implementation I could find, with implementation choices that should work for 95% of use cases, but no cruft to cover the other 5%.

## Run benchmarks

```bash
npm run benchmarks
```

Benchmark results comparing this library to [array-flatten]:

```bash
#1: large.js
  arr-flatten.js x 475,421 ops/sec ±0.47% (97 runs sampled)
  array-flatten.js x 366,739 ops/sec ±0.47% (98 runs sampled)

#2: medium.js
  arr-flatten.js x 1,882,187 ops/sec ±0.80% (93 runs sampled)
  array-flatten.js x 1,384,760 ops/sec ±0.70% (98 runs sampled)

#3: small.js
  arr-flatten.js x 5,189,601 ops/sec ±0.74% (98 runs sampled)
  array-flatten.js x 4,306,749 ops/sec ±0.75% (98 runs sampled)
```

The bigger the array, the bigger the speed difference.
